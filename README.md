Projectâ€™s Title: survival 3D-Spil

Description: In this game, a soldier finds himself alone on an island while his comrades are on a three-day mission. He must defend his base from robot enemies who are attempting to destroy it and seize control of the island.
The soldier starts with only an axe, and as he harvests trees and stones with it, he gathers enough resources to purchase weapons and receive assistance in defeating these enemies.
But as the days go by, more come; during the day, there are fewer than at night, where the daytime can be used to gather resources and prepare for the night.
If the soldier survives and manages to protect the base for all three days, his fellow soldiers will reach it and help, and the game is won.
